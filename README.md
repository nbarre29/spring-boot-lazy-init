Certainly! Let's create a complex example using the find and includes methods to search for a specific item in an array of objects and conditionally add a new object to the array. In this example, we have an array of books, and we want to add a new book only if it doesn't already exist in the array.


// Original array of books
let books = [
  { id: 1, title: 'The Great Gatsby', author: 'F. Scott Fitzgerald' },
  { id: 2, title: 'To Kill a Mockingbird', author: 'Harper Lee' },
  { id: 3, title: '1984', author: 'George Orwell' }
];

// Function to add a book to the array if it doesn't already exist
function addBookIfNotExists(newBook) {
  // Check if a book with the same title already exists
  const existingBook = books.find(book => book.title === newBook.title);

  if (!existingBook) {
    // If the book doesn't exist, add it to the array
    books.push(newBook);
    console.log(`Added "${newBook.title}" by ${newBook.author} to the array.`);
  } else {
    console.log(`"${newBook.title}" by ${newBook.author} already exists in the array.`);
  }
}

// Initial array of books and length
console.log('Original Array of Books:', books);
console.log('Array Length:', books.length);

// Add books based on conditions
addBookIfNotExists({ id: 4, title: 'The Catcher in the Rye', author: 'J.D. Salinger' });
addBookIfNotExists({ id: 2, title: 'To Kill a Mockingbird', author: 'Harper Lee' });
addBookIfNotExists({ id: 5, title: 'The Catcher in the Rye', author: 'J.D. Salinger' });

// Updated array of books and length
console.log('Updated Array of Books:', books);
console.log('Array Length:', books.length);



In this example:

The find method is used to search for a book with the same title as the new book.
The includes method is not directly used here, but it's part of the comparison within the addBookIfNotExists function.
If the book doesn't already exist, it is added to the array; otherwise, a message is logged indicating that the book already exists.
