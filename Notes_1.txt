1. Trust the Development Certificate

Visual Studio provides a development certificate to support HTTPS in local development. Follow these steps to ensure the certificate is installed and trusted:

    Open a terminal (Command Prompt or PowerShell).

    Run the following command:
	dotnet dev-certs https --trust
	
	You may see a prompt to confirm the installation. Accept the prompt to trust the certificate.

    On Windows, this command configures the certificate as trusted for your system.
	
2. Check Certificate Installation

If the certificate installation didn't work or you still face issues:

    Open Manage User Certificates:
        Press Win + R, type certmgr.msc, and press Enter.
    Navigate to Personal > Certificates and look for a certificate named localhost issued by ASP.NET Core HTTPS development certificate.
    If itâ€™s missing or invalid, delete it (if present) and repeat the dotnet dev-certs https --trust command.
