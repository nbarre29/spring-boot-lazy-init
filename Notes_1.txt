    Solution Explorer (right side):
        Shows project structure with .cshtml files, C# files (.cs), and JSON configuration files.
        Solution named IntakeWeb, typical for ASP.NET Core MVC projects.

    Code Editor:
        Syntax highlighting for HTML, C# Razor syntax, and CSS.
        Line numbers, indentation, and styling consistent with Visual Studio.

    Menus and Toolbars:
        Classic Visual Studio toolbar options like Build, Debug, Tools, etc.
        Icons and layout resemble Visual Studio 2019/2022.

    Panels:
        Bottom-left shows output, developer tools, and other panels commonly found in Visual Studio.
		
		
Summary:

The editor is Microsoft Visual Studio, likely Visual Studio 2019 or 2022, as it is commonly used for .NET Core projects.



you can use Visual Studio Code (VS Code) instead of Visual Studio 2019/2022 to develop .NET Core applications. Visual Studio Code is a lightweight and flexible editor that supports C# and .NET development with the help of extensions. However, there are a few key differences and considerations to keep in mind.


How to Use Visual Studio Code for .NET Core Development

    Install Prerequisites:
        .NET SDK: Ensure you have the .NET SDK installed. Download it from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download.
        Visual Studio Code: Download and install VS Code from code.visualstudio.com.

    Install C# Extension:
        Go to the Extensions Marketplace in VS Code (Ctrl+Shift+X or click the Extensions icon).
        Search for the C# extension (provided by Microsoft) and install it.
            This extension provides IntelliSense, debugging, and project templates for C# development.
			
	Build and Run the Project:
	
	    Use the integrated terminal to build and run your project:
		dotnet build
        dotnet run
		
		Your application will run, and you can access it via http://localhost:5000 (or a port specified in the terminal).
		
		
	Debugging
	    VS Code supports debugging for .NET Core applications:

    Place breakpoints in your C# files.
    Press F5 to start debugging.
    The C# extension automatically configures the launch.json file for debugging.
