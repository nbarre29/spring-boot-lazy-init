To test your Spring Boot application jar with Camunda Zeebe, Operate, Elasticsearch, and Tasklist running locally, you don't need to copy the jar file to a specific location. Instead, you can run the jar file directly using the Java command.

Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide to running your application jar and ensuring it interacts with your locally running services:


Prerequisites
Ensure that:

ElasticSearch, Zeebe, Operate, and Tasklist are running locally.
Your application is configured to connect to these services.



1) Ensure your application.properties or application.yml in your Spring Boot application is correctly configured to connect to your local instances. For example:

# Zeebe
zeebe.client.broker.contactPoint=localhost:26500
zeebe.client.security.plaintext=true

# Operate and Tasklist settings, if needed
# ...

# Elasticsearch
spring.elasticsearch.rest.uris=http://localhost:9200


2) Run Your Application
Navigate to the directory where your application.jar is located and run it using the following command:

java -jar application.jar

It will start your Spring Boot application and it will connect to the local instances of Zeebe, Operate, and Elasticsearch as configured.


3)
Access Camunda Operate and Tasklist
Camunda Operate: Open a web browser and navigate to http://localhost:8080 to access Camunda Operate.
Camunda Tasklist: Open a web browser and navigate to http://localhost:8081 to access the Tasklist (adjust the port if necessary).
