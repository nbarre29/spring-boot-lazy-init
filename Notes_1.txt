In IBM Operational Decision Manager (ODM), a Condition and a Conditional Precondition play key roles in defining when a rule should be executed.

1. Condition in ODM Ruleset

A condition is part of the rule that evaluates to true or false. If the condition is true, the rule's actions are executed. Conditions are usually written in Business Action Language (BAL) or Decision Table format.

Example of a Condition in a Rule

if the customer age is greater than 18
then approve the loan application;

Here, the condition is:

customer age is greater than 18

If this evaluates to true, the action (approve the loan application) is executed.


2. Conditional Precondition in ODM

A Conditional Precondition is used to ensure that certain data or conditions exist before the rule is even considered for evaluation. If the precondition is not met, the rule is not even checked.

Example of a Conditional Precondition

Let's say we have a rule that applies only if a customer object exists. The precondition ensures that the rule does not execute if the customer is null.



definitions:
   set 'customer' to 'the customer record';

preconditions:
   the customer is not null;

if the customer age is greater than 18
then approve the loan application;


Here, the precondition ensures that the rule only executes if the customer is not null. If customer is null, the rule is not even evaluated.


When to Use What?

    Use conditions to specify when a rule should execute.
    Use conditional preconditions to filter out irrelevant cases before rule execution, reducing unnecessary processing.

Scenario: A rule determines loan eligibility based on credit score and income.
Rule:  If creditScore > 750 AND income > 50000, then approve the loan.


Condition

    creditScore > 750
    income > 50000
    These conditions are combined using an AND operator to evaluate loan approval.

Conditional Precondition

    Ensures that the rule applies only to applicants from the USA.
    Precondition: applicantCountry == "USA"

Interpretation

    If applicantCountry == "USA", the rule engine evaluates credit score and income.
    If applicantCountry != "USA", the rule is skipped, and the loan application is ignored for this rule.

Key Takeaways

    Condition: Controls when the rule executes.
    Conditional Precondition: Controls whether the rule should be evaluated at all.

This approach optimizes rule execution by filtering out unnecessary evaluations early.
