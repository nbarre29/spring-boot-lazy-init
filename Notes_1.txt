Understanding JBoss ODM

JBoss ODM (Red Hat Decision Manager) is a business rules management system (BRMS) built on Drools. It allows you to:

    Create and manage rules using DRL, decision tables, or DMN models.
    Deploy those rules as RESTful services for external applications to call.

By default:

    JBoss ODM provides REST APIs for invoking rules or DMN models.
    These APIs are designed to work over HTTP, which can be easily called from any HTTP-capable client, including Node.js.

However, JBoss ODM does not provide a Node.js-specific SDK or integration out of the box.



How to Integrate Node.js with JBoss ODM

You can achieve integration by exposing the rules engine as a REST service or using a direct invocation strategy. Here's how:
Option 1: Expose JBoss ODM as a REST Service

JBoss ODM can expose decision tables, DRL rules, or DMN models as RESTful endpoints. These endpoints can then be invoked from a Node.js application.

    Deploy Rules in JBoss ODM:
        Package your rules in a KJAR (Knowledge JAR).
        Deploy the KJAR in the Decision Manager server or a Spring Boot-based Drools service.

    Access the REST API:
        Use the REST API exposed by JBoss ODM to invoke the deployed rules or decision tables.

    Example API Endpoint:

POST http://<jboss-odm-server>/kie-server/services/rest/server/containers/<container-id>/dmn
Content-Type: application/json

Call the API from Node.js: Use an HTTP client in Node.js (e.g., Axios, node-fetch) to call the REST endpoint.

Example:

    const axios = require("axios");

    async function invokeDecision(payload) {
        const response = await axios.post(
            "http://<jboss-odm-server>/kie-server/services/rest/server/containers/<container-id>/dmn",
            payload,
            {
                headers: {
                    "Content-Type": "application/json",
                    "Authorization": "Basic <base64-encoded-credentials>"
                }
            }
        );
        return response.data;
    }

    const payload = {
        "model-namespace": "http://www.example.com/dmn",
        "model-name": "DecisionModel",
        "decision-name": "DecisionName",
        "context": {
            "input1": "value1",
            "input2": "value2"
        }
    };

    invokeDecision(payload).then(result => console.log(result)).catch(err => console.error(err));

Option 2: Direct Invocation (Java Bridge)

If exposing a REST API is not an option, you can create a Java-based bridge service to interact with JBoss ODM and call this service from Node.js.

    Create a Java Microservice:
        Write a Java application using the Drools API to directly execute rules.
        Expose the service as a RESTful endpoint (e.g., using Spring Boot or JAX-RS).

    Invoke the Service from Node.js:
        Use an HTTP client in Node.js to call the exposed endpoint (similar to Option 1).

Option 3: gRPC or Socket Communication

If you require faster or more persistent communication:

    Implement a Java service to invoke JBoss ODM and expose it via gRPC or WebSockets.
    Use a Node.js gRPC client or WebSocket library to interact with the Java service.

Key Considerations

    Authentication: JBoss ODM REST APIs typically require basic authentication or token-based authentication. Ensure your Node.js client handles this securely.
    Performance: For high-performance use cases, consider using a Java service with persistent KieSession instances to avoid the overhead of creating sessions for every API call.
    Data Transformation: Map your Node.js application inputs/outputs to match the JBoss ODM decision model's requirements (DMN context or DRL facts).

Conclusion

While JBoss ODM does not natively support direct integration with Node.js, you can:

    Use its REST APIs for straightforward integration.
    Create a Java bridge service for advanced use cases or custom workflows.
	
	
-> The drools-kie-client package is a Node.js library that enables integration with a Drools KIE server. It is designed to work with the KIE Server REST API exposed by the Drools platform. The KIE Server is part of the Drools ecosystem, which provides a RESTful interface to interact with rules, decision models, and process workflows.

Hereâ€™s an explanation of how the service is exposed from Drools and how it can be used with the drools-kie-client.
How Drools Service is Exposed

Drools uses the KIE Server to expose its services, which include:

    Rules Execution (using DRL files, decision tables, or DMN models).
    Process Execution (for BPMN workflows).
    Case Management (using CMMN models).

The KIE Server provides a REST API for executing these services. It is configured to run as part of a standalone application server (e.g., WildFly, Tomcat) or embedded in custom Java applications.
Steps to Expose the Drools Service

    Deploy a KJAR to the KIE Server:
        Package your rules (DRL, decision tables, or DMN models) into a KJAR (Knowledge JAR).
        Deploy this KJAR to the KIE Server using the Workbench (Business Central) or Maven.

    Access the KIE Server REST API: The KIE Server will expose endpoints for:
        Executing rules.
        Evaluating DMN models.
        Invoking processes.

    Example endpoints:
        Execute Rules:

POST http://<kie-server-host>:<port>/kie-server/services/rest/server/containers/<container-id>/ksession

Evaluate DMN Models:

        POST http://<kie-server-host>:<port>/kie-server/services/rest/server/containers/<container-id>/dmn

    Configure the KIE Server:
        Ensure the server is configured with the correct schema, container IDs, and user authentication.
        Enable the REST endpoints by running the KIE Server with the proper configurations.

Using drools-kie-client to Call Drools Services

The drools-kie-client is a wrapper library that simplifies interaction with the KIE Server's REST API from a Node.js application.
Example Usage

    Install the Library: Install the drools-kie-client package:

npm install drools-kie-client

Create a Client to Access the KIE Server: Use the library to configure the connection to the KIE Server.

const { KieClient } = require("drools-kie-client");

const kieClient = new KieClient({
    host: "http://<kie-server-host>:<port>",
    containerId: "<container-id>",
    user: "<username>",
    password: "<password>"
});

Call the Drools Service: Use the client to execute rules or evaluate DMN models.

    Execute Rules:

const payload = {
    facts: [
        { name: "customer", value: { age: 30, type: "REGULAR" } }
    ]
};

kieClient.executeRules(payload)
    .then(response => {
        console.log("Rules execution result:", response);
    })
    .catch(error => {
        console.error("Error executing rules:", error);
    });

Evaluate a DMN Model:

        const payload = {
            "model-namespace": "http://example.com/dmn",
            "model-name": "DecisionModel",
            "context": {
                "input1": "value1",
                "input2": "value2"
            }
        };

        kieClient.evaluateDMN(payload)
            .then(response => {
                console.log("DMN evaluation result:", response);
            })
            .catch(error => {
                console.error("Error evaluating DMN:", error);
            });

Key Considerations

    Authentication:
        Ensure the KIE Server is secured using basic authentication or token-based authentication.
        Pass the credentials (user and password) in the client configuration.

    Container ID:
        The container-id refers to the deployed KJAR in the KIE Server. This must match the container ID used during deployment.

    API Endpoints:
        Ensure the KIE Server endpoints are correctly exposed and accessible from your Node.js application.

    DMN vs DRL:
        Use evaluateDMN for decision tables or DMN models.
        Use executeRules for rules written in DRL files.

    Payload Structure:
        Match the input facts or DMN context with the rules/decision model requirements.

Troubleshooting

    If you encounter issues, verify the following:
        The KIE Server is running and accessible at the specified host and port.
        The container ID is correct and the rules are deployed.
        The payload format matches the expected input for the rules or decision models.

By exposing Drools services via the KIE Server and using the drools-kie-client, you can integrate powerful rule execution capabilities into your Node.js applications. Let me know if you need help with a specific use case!
