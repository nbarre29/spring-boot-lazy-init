To implement the rules in the image within a Spring-based Java application for a mortgage pricing engine, you'll need to break down the logic into distinct components. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step approach to how you can implement it:
1. Define the Structure of Rules:

The rules you have are quite conditional, so the first step is to define them in a structured format. You can use a combination of Java classes and methods to encapsulate these rules.
2. Define Rule Classes:

Each rule can be represented by a method or class that checks the conditions. You can encapsulate each rule in a service or utility class.
Example Rule Class

public class LockRequestRule {
    
    public boolean checkLockRequestCondition(LocalDateTime currentDateTime, 
                                              SellerSettings sellerSettings, 
                                              GlobalSettings globalSettings, 
                                              AggregatePipelineData aggregateData) {
        boolean isWithinLockHours = isWithinLockHours(currentDateTime, sellerSettings, globalSettings);
        boolean isCommitmentBalanceValid = isCommitmentBalanceValid(aggregateData, sellerSettings);
        boolean isOvernightLimitNull = sellerSettings.getOvernightCommitmentLimit() == null;

        return isWithinLockHours && isCommitmentBalanceValid && isOvernightLimitNull;
    }

    private boolean isWithinLockHours(LocalDateTime currentDateTime, SellerSettings sellerSettings, GlobalSettings globalSettings) {
        // Check if currentDateTime is in seller's lock desk hours but not in global lock desk hours
        return sellerSettings.getLockDeskHours().contains(currentDateTime) &&
               !globalSettings.getLockDeskHours().contains(currentDateTime);
    }

    private boolean isCommitmentBalanceValid(AggregatePipelineData aggregateData, SellerSettings sellerSettings) {
        // Check if the sum of commitment loan balance is less than the overnight limit
        return aggregateData.getCommitmentLoanBalance() < sellerSettings.getOvernightCommitmentLimit();
    }
}

3. Define Configuration Classes:

For each entity like SellerSettings, GlobalSettings, and AggregatePipelineData, create configuration classes to hold the data necessary for rule checks.
Example Configuration Class

public class SellerSettings {
    private List<LocalDateTime> lockDeskHours;
    private Double overnightCommitmentLimit;
    private boolean automatedLockApprovals;

    // Getters and Setters
}

public class GlobalSettings {
    private List<LocalDateTime> lockDeskHours;
    private boolean automatedLockApprovals;

    // Getters and Setters
}

public class AggregatePipelineData {
    private Double commitmentLoanBalance;

    // Getters and Setters
}

4. Service Layer for Rule Execution:

Create a service class to execute and evaluate the conditions based on user input or data provided to the engine.
Example Service Class:

@Service
public class MortgagePricingService {

    private final LockRequestRule lockRequestRule;

    @Autowired
    public MortgagePricingService(LockRequestRule lockRequestRule) {
        this.lockRequestRule = lockRequestRule;
    }

    public String processLockRequest(LocalDateTime currentDateTime, 
                                      SellerSettings sellerSettings, 
                                      GlobalSettings globalSettings, 
                                      AggregatePipelineData aggregateData) {
        boolean isLockRequestValid = lockRequestRule.checkLockRequestCondition(currentDateTime, 
                                                                               sellerSettings, 
                                                                               globalSettings, 
                                                                               aggregateData);
        
        if (isLockRequestValid) {
            return "PASS";
        } else {
            return "FAIL";
        }
    }
}

5. Automated Lock Approval Logic:

For automated lock approvals and exception handling, you can implement additional checks for these conditions. Similar to the previous logic, create a class that checks conditions like the Product-Automated Lock Approvals and Global-Automated Lock Approvals.
Example Automated Lock Approval Class:

public class AutomatedLockApprovalRule {
    
    public boolean checkAutomatedLockApproval(SellerSettings sellerSettings, 
                                              GlobalSettings globalSettings) {
        return sellerSettings.isAutomatedLockApprovals() && globalSettings.isAutomatedLockApprovals();
    }
}

6. Exception Handling and Eligibility Rules:

For more complex rules like eligibility checks, you can implement rules that check for exception overrides or specific eligibility conditions.
Example Eligibility Rule Class:

public class EligibilityRules {
    
    public boolean checkEligibility(int rulesOutput, String ruleType) {
        if ("Refer".equals(ruleType) && rulesOutput > 0) {
            return true;  // Rule passes if there are more than 0 rules with 'Refer' result
        } else if ("FAIL".equals(ruleType) && rulesOutput == 0) {
            return true;  // Rule passes if no rules with 'FAIL' result
        }
        return false;
    }
}

7. Connecting the Rules:

Once you have these components defined, you can connect them in the service layer where the rules are evaluated, and based on the inputs (product ID, seller settings, global settings), the corresponding conditions are checked.

8. Integration with Spring:

Once the rules and service layer are in place, integrate these components with your existing Spring Boot application. You can expose these rule evaluations via REST controllers for integration with your front end or other services.
Example Controller:

@RestController
@RequestMapping("/api/mortgage")
public class MortgageController {

    private final MortgagePricingService mortgagePricingService;

    @Autowired
    public MortgageController(MortgagePricingService mortgagePricingService) {
        this.mortgagePricingService = mortgagePricingService;
    }

    @PostMapping("/processLockRequest")
    public ResponseEntity<String> processLockRequest(@RequestBody LockRequest lockRequest) {
        String result = mortgagePricingService.processLockRequest(
            lockRequest.getCurrentDateTime(),
            lockRequest.getSellerSettings(),
            lockRequest.getGlobalSettings(),
            lockRequest.getAggregatePipelineData()
        );
        return ResponseEntity.ok(result);
    }
}

9. Testing:

You should also write unit tests for each of these rules and service methods to ensure they are functioning as expected.
Example Unit Test:

@RunWith(SpringRunner.class)
@SpringBootTest
public class MortgagePricingServiceTest {

    @Autowired
    private MortgagePricingService mortgagePricingService;

    @MockBean
    private LockRequestRule lockRequestRule;

    @Test
    public void testProcessLockRequest() {
        // Create mock inputs
        SellerSettings sellerSettings = new SellerSettings();
        GlobalSettings globalSettings = new GlobalSettings();
        AggregatePipelineData aggregateData = new AggregatePipelineData();

        // Define behavior of mock rule
        Mockito.when(lockRequestRule.checkLockRequestCondition(
            Mockito.any(), Mockito.any(), Mockito.any(), Mockito.any()))
            .thenReturn(true);  // simulate rule pass

        // Call service method
        String result = mortgagePricingService.processLockRequest(
            LocalDateTime.now(), sellerSettings, globalSettings, aggregateData);

        // Assert result
        assertEquals("PASS", result);
    }
}

10. Enhancing the Rule Engine:

As the complexity of rules increases, you might consider using a rule engine (like Drools) to dynamically define and evaluate rules in your application.
Conclusion:

You can implement these rules by structuring the logic in classes and utilizing Spring services to execute the rules. Each rule can be encapsulated in its own class, and Spring can manage the dependencies and service orchestration. You can enhance flexibility by allowing rules to be added or modified dynamically, depending on business needs.
