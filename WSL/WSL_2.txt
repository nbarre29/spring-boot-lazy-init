ping: google.com: Temporary failure in name resolution


Step 1: Check Network Connectivity

Run the following inside WSL:

ping -c 4 google.com

    If you get a response (successful ping), your internet is working.
    If it fails, check your DNS settings in Step 2.

ðŸ›  Step 2: Fix DNS Issues

WSL sometimes struggles with DNS resolution. To manually set a reliable DNS:
1) Open the DNS configuration file:

sudo nano /etc/resolv.conf

2) Replace its content with:

nameserver 8.8.8.8
nameserver 8.8.4.4

(These are Googleâ€™s public DNS servers.)
3) Save and exit (CTRL + X, then Y, then ENTER).
4) Prevent WSL from overwriting this file:

sudo chattr +i /etc/resolv.conf

Now, test again:

ping -c 4 google.com

-> 172.20.224.1 is not a Google DNS server. It is likely your local WSL virtual network gateway assigned by Windows.
ðŸ“Œ Understanding 172.20.224.1 in WSL

    WSL2 uses a virtualized network and assigns a private IP range like 172.20.x.x for internal communication between Windows and WSL.
    172.20.224.1 is usually the default gateway for WSL2â€™s network, but it may not always work for DNS resolution.

âœ… Use Googleâ€™s Public DNS for Reliability

To fix potential internet issues, replace 172.20.224.1 with Googleâ€™s Public DNS:
1) Open the DNS Config File in WSL

sudo nano /etc/resolv.conf

2) Replace its content with:

nameserver 8.8.8.8
nameserver 8.8.4.4

    8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4 are Googleâ€™s public DNS servers.
    These servers are faster and more reliable than local WSL-assigned DNS.
