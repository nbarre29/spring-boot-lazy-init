-> Dependency injection (DI) is a process whereby objects define their dependencies (that is, the other objects with which they work) only through constructor arguments. provide example code to explain this statement

public interface MessageService {
    void sendMessage(String message, String recipient);
}

public class EmailService implements MessageService {
    @Override
    public void sendMessage(String message, String recipient) {
        System.out.println("Email sent to " + recipient + " with message: " + message);
    }
}

public class MessageProcessor {
    private final MessageService messageService;

    // Constructor injection
    public MessageProcessor(MessageService messageService) {
        this.messageService = messageService;
    }

    public void processMessage(String message, String recipient) {
        messageService.sendMessage(message, recipient);
    }
}


public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Inject the dependency via the constructor
        MessageService emailService = new EmailService();
        MessageProcessor processor = new MessageProcessor(emailService);

        // Use the processor to send a message
        processor.processMessage("Hello, World!", "example@example.com");
    }
}

Output:
Email sent to example@example.com with message: Hello, World!


1. Dependency Injection: The MessageProcessor class depends on the MessageService interface to perform its function, and this dependency is injected through the constructor. This pattern is known as constructor injection, a common form of dependency injection.

2. Loose Coupling: By depending on the MessageService interface rather than a specific implementation (like EmailService), the MessageProcessor class is loosely coupled to the MessageService implementation. This allows you to swap EmailService with another implementation of MessageService without changing the MessageProcessor code.

3. Easier Testing: Because MessageProcessor depends on an interface, you can easily substitute a mock or stub implementation of MessageService in tests. This enables isolated testing of MessageProcessorâ€™s behavior without relying on a specific MessageService implementation.
