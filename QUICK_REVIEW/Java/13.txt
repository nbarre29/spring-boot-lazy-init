-> 
1) Name Change:
Microsoft rebranded Azure AD to Microsoft Entra ID.   
This change is part of Microsoft's effort to unify its identity and network access product family under the Microsoft Entra umbrella.   

Functionality:
2) The underlying functionality and capabilities of Azure AD remain the same in Microsoft Entra ID.   
This is purely a name change, and existing features, licensing, and service level agreements are unaffected.

3) Purpose:
Microsoft Entra ID continues to be an identity and access management solution that helps organizations secure and manage identities in cloud and on-premises environments.   

_________________________________________________________________________

-> Let's break down the roles of the different components in your React frontend, Spring Boot backend, and Azure Entra ID setup:

1. Azure Entra ID (Formerly Azure Active Directory)

Authorization Server (and Identity Provider - IdP):
Azure Entra ID is the central authority that manages user identities and issues security tokens.
It handles user authentication (verifying usernames and passwords, etc.).
It issues access tokens, ID tokens, and refresh tokens.
It defines the authorization policies and permissions.
In essence, Entra ID is the one that says "Yes, this user is who they say they are, and they are allowed to do these things."

2. React Frontend Application

Client Application (or Relying Party - RP):
Your React application is the client that wants to access protected resources (your Spring Boot APIs).
It initiates the authentication process by redirecting the user to Azure Entra ID.
It receives the tokens (access and ID) from Azure Entra ID.
It sends the access token to the Spring Boot backend in the Authorization header of API requests.
It uses the Id token to get user information to display on the front end.


3. Spring Boot Backend Application

Resource Server:
Your Spring Boot application hosts the protected resources (your APIs).
It receives the access token from the React frontend.
It validates the access token against Azure Entra ID to ensure its authenticity and validity.
It authorizes the user based on the permissions granted in the access token.
It serves the data that the front end application requests.

Key Points

Trust Relationship: Your Spring Boot backend trusts Azure Entra ID to issue valid tokens.
OAuth 2.0: The communication between these components follows the OAuth 2.0 authorization code grant flow.
JWTs: The tokens issued by Azure Entra ID are typically JSON Web Tokens (JWTs).
Decoupling: This setup decouples authentication and authorization from your applications, making it more secure and maintainable.

In summary:

Azure Entra ID: The "gatekeeper" that verifies user identities and issues tokens.
React Frontend: The "messenger" that requests and uses the tokens.
Spring Boot Backend: The "resource provider" that protects its resources and verifies the tokens.
