Here is a curated list of core Java interview questions on Threads and Concurrency, along with brief explanations where necessary:
Basic Thread Concepts

    What is a thread in Java?
        A thread is a lightweight process and the smallest unit of execution in Java. It allows concurrent execution of tasks.

    How do you create a thread in Java?
        By extending the Thread class or implementing the Runnable interface.

    What is the difference between start() and run() methods in Java threads?
        start(): Creates a new thread and calls the run() method on that thread.
        run(): Executes the code in the current thread; no new thread is created.

    How do you stop a thread in Java?
        Use a volatile flag or interrupt the thread with Thread.interrupt().
        Deprecated methods like stop() should not be used due to unsafe behavior.

    What is the lifecycle of a thread in Java?
        States: NEW, RUNNABLE, BLOCKED, WAITING, TIMED_WAITING, and TERMINATED.

    What is the difference between sleep() and wait()?
        sleep(): Temporarily pauses the current thread for a specified time. Does not release locks.
        wait(): Causes the current thread to wait until notified. It releases the lock on the object.

    What is the difference between yield() and sleep()?
        yield(): Suggests to the thread scheduler to pause the current thread and allow other threads of equal priority to execute.
        sleep(): Pauses the thread for a specified time regardless of other threads.

Thread Synchronization and Locks

    What is thread synchronization in Java?
        Synchronization ensures that only one thread accesses a shared resource at a time, preventing race conditions.

    What is the purpose of the synchronized keyword?
        It ensures mutual exclusion by locking a method or block, allowing only one thread to execute it at a time.

    What is a deadlock? How can it be avoided?
        Deadlock occurs when two or more threads are waiting for each other's resources indefinitely.
        Avoid using nested locks and maintain consistent lock ordering.

    What is the difference between synchronized methods and synchronized blocks?
        Methods: Locks the entire object.
        Blocks: Locks only the code inside the block, allowing finer-grained control.

    What is a reentrant lock in Java?
        A lock that allows a thread to acquire it multiple times without causing itself to block (e.g., ReentrantLock).

Concurrency and Advanced Threading

    What is the difference between volatile and synchronized?
        volatile ensures visibility of changes to variables across threads but does not provide atomicity.
        synchronized ensures both visibility and atomicity but involves locking, which can be slower.

    What is the Executor framework in Java?
        A framework that provides a higher-level API for managing threads, such as Executor, ExecutorService, and ScheduledExecutorService.

    What is ForkJoinPool in Java?
        A thread pool designed for divide-and-conquer tasks, such as splitting a large task into smaller ones and joining their results.

    What is Callable and Future in Java?
        Callable: A task that returns a result and can throw exceptions.
        Future: Represents the result of an asynchronous computation.

    What is a thread pool?
        A collection of pre-created threads used to execute multiple tasks, reducing the overhead of thread creation and destruction.

    What are the differences between Thread and ExecutorService?
        Thread creates and manages a single thread.
        ExecutorService manages a pool of threads and provides advanced task management.

Thread Communication

    How do threads communicate in Java?
        Using methods like wait(), notify(), and notifyAll() on shared objects.

    What is a CountDownLatch?
        A synchronization aid that allows one or more threads to wait until a set of operations performed by other threads completes.

    What is a CyclicBarrier?
        A synchronization aid that allows a set of threads to wait at a barrier point until all threads in the group reach that point.

    What is the difference between CountDownLatch and CyclicBarrier?
        CountDownLatch: Cannot be reused once the count reaches zero.
        CyclicBarrier: Can be reused after all threads reach the barrier.

    What is a Semaphore?
        A synchronization tool that restricts the number of threads that can access a resource simultaneously.

Concurrency Problems

    What is a race condition?
        A condition where the outcome of a program depends on the timing or sequence of threads accessing shared resources.

    What is starvation?
        A thread is perpetually denied access to resources because other threads monopolize them.

    What is livelock?
        Threads keep changing their states in response to each other but fail to make progress.

    What is a thread-safe class?
        A class designed to be safely used by multiple threads without external synchronization.

    What is an Atomic class in Java?
        Classes like AtomicInteger, AtomicLong, and AtomicReference provide lock-free, thread-safe operations on single variables.

Memory and Performance

    What is the Java Memory Model (JMM)?
        Defines how threads interact through memory and guarantees visibility of changes to variables across threads.

    What is the difference between Stack and Heap in thread memory?
        Each thread has its own stack for method calls and local variables.
        The heap is shared among all threads for object storage.

    What are some common thread performance tips?
        Minimize the use of synchronized blocks.
        Use thread-safe collections like ConcurrentHashMap.
        Avoid creating too many threads; use thread pools.

Tricky Questions

    Can a thread acquire multiple locks?
        Yes, a thread can acquire multiple locks, but improper locking can lead to deadlocks.

    What happens if a thread calls wait() on an object it doesnâ€™t own?
        A IllegalMonitorStateException is thrown.

    What is the difference between notify() and notifyAll()?
        notify() wakes up a single thread waiting on the object's monitor.
        notifyAll() wakes up all threads waiting on the object's monitor.

    What is the difference between ConcurrentHashMap and Collections.synchronizedMap()?
        ConcurrentHashMap allows concurrent read operations and uses finer-grained locking.
        Collections.synchronizedMap() locks the entire map for every operation.

Real-World Scenarios

    Explain how you would use a thread pool to handle thousands of tasks efficiently.
    How would you design a producer-consumer system using BlockingQueue?
    How can you handle thread-safe lazy initialization in Java? (Answer: Use synchronized or AtomicReference.)

These questions cover the fundamental and advanced concepts of threads and concurrency, helping you prepare for interviews comprehensively.
