-> Steps to Create the Console App and open in Visual Studio Code

Install dotnet
Install Visual Studio Code Extensions: C# Dev Kit

Steps to Create the Console App
1. Create a New Folder

Create a folder for your project and navigate to it:

mkdir MyConsoleApp
cd MyConsoleApp

2. Initialize the Console Application

Use the following command to create a new console application:

dotnet new console

This will generate the basic structure for a .NET console app:

    Program.cs (Main entry point)
    .csproj file (Project configuration)

3. Open the Project in VS Code

Launch Visual Studio Code in the current folder:

code .

4. Build and Run the Application

    Open the integrated terminal in VS Code (Ctrl+`` ).
    Use the following commands to build and run your application:

dotnet build
dotnet run


-> .NET 6 uses C# 10 by default.

int[] scores = [1, 2, 3, 4];

The syntax using collection expressions, was introduced in C# 12, which comes with .NET 8.


To achieve the same functionality in .NET 6 (C# 10), you can use the traditional syntax:
Using Array Initialization:

int[] scores = new int[] { 1, 2, 3, 4 };

Or, if the type can be inferred:

var scores = new int[] { 1, 2, 3, 4 };
