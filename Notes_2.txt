means that the TaskStatus column in the dbo.Task table is updated with the value of @taskStatus if @taskStatus is not NULL. If @taskStatus is NULL, the TaskStatus column retains its original value.

In simpler terms:

If @taskStatus has a value, update TaskStatus to this value.
If @taskStatus is NULL, keep the current value of TaskStatus.


ISNULL: TaskStatus = ISNULL(@taskStatus, TaskStatus) checks if @taskStatus is NULL. If it is, it uses the current value of TaskStatus.
COALESCE: AssignedUserID = COALESCE(@assignedUserID, AssignedUserID) checks if @assignedUserID is NULL. If it is, it uses the current value of AssignedUserID.


We could  use either ISNULL or COALESCE depending on the specific needs and readability. Since they are functionally similar in this context, either can be used to achieve the same result.
